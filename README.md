# BPM AI Connectors for Camunda ü§ñ

*Boost automation in your Camunda BPMN processes using pre-configured, task-specific AI solutions - wrapped in easy-to-use connectors üöÄ*

These connectors automate activities in business processes that previously required user tasks or specialized AI models, like:
* üîç **Information extraction** from unstructured data (emails, letters, documents, ...)
* ‚öñ  Informed **decision-making** before gateways
* ‚úçüèº Creative **content generation** (emails, letters, ...)
* üåç **Translation**

... and soon (experimental):
* üìÑ **Answering questions** over documents, wikis and other unstructured knowledge-bases
* üóÑ Querying **SQL Databases**
* üåê Interacting with **REST APIs**
* ...and more

**Just provide input and output variable mappings** and configure what you want to achieve - the connectors will do the heavy lifting:
1. Crafting tested, task- and model-specific prompts (for LLMs)
2. Interfacing with the AI model provider or runtime (like OpenAI GPT or Huggingface Transformers)
3. Parsing the output into process variables
4. Handling and automatically fixing common error cases

## üöÄ How to Run Using Docker

Create an `.env` file (use `env.sample` as a template) and fill in your Zeebe cluster information (for either cloud or a local cluster) and your OpenAI API key (if needed):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<put your key here>

ZEEBE_CLIENT_CLOUD_CLUSTER-ID=<cluster-id>
ZEEBE_CLIENT_CLOUD_CLIENT-ID=<client-id>
ZEEBE_CLIENT_CLOUD_CLIENT-SECRET=<client-secret>
ZEEBE_CLIENT_CLOUD_REGION=<cluster-region>

# OR

ZEEBE_CLIENT_BROKER_GATEWAY-ADDRESS=zeebe:26500
```

### (Optional): Run local zeebe cluster

If you are not using Camunda Cloud, start a local cluster:

```bash 
docker compose -f docker-compose.camunda-platform.yml up -d
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run connectors

Run the connector runtime using a pre-built image from DockerHub:

```bash 
docker run --env-file .env holisticon/bpm-ai-connectors-camunda-8:latest 
```

### Use Element Templates in your Processes

After starting the connector workers in their runtime, you also need to make the connectors known to the Modeler in order to actually model processes with them:

* Upload the element templates from [/bpmn/.camunda/element-templates](/bpmn/.camunda/element-templates) to your project in Camunda Cloud Modeler 
  * Click `publish` on each one
* Or, if you're working locally:
  * place them besides your .bpmn file
  * or add them to the `resources/element-templates` directory of your Modeler. 

## üïµ Logging & Tracing

The connectors support logging traces of all task runs into [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com).

This makes it easy to debug problems, monitor latency and cost, analyze task performance and even curate and export datasets from your past runs.

To configure tracing, add your keys to the `.env` file:

```bash
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<put your secret key here>
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<put your public key here>

# only if self-hosted:
#LANGFUSE_HOST=host:port
```

## üèó Development & Project Setup

The connector workers are written in Python based on [pyzeebe](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/pyzeebe).
They are a thin wrapper around the core logic and AI abstractions, 
which are independent of the specific workflow engine (or can even be integrated in a plain Python project directly) and placed 
in a separate repository: [bpm-ai](https://github.com/holunda-io/bpm-ai)

All connectors make use of feel expressions to flexibly map the task result into one or multiple result variables and/or define error expressions. 
Therefore, a feel engine is required - which is only available as a Scala implementation. 
To keep the runtime and Docker image overhead of needing an accompanying JVM app as low as possible,
[feel-engine-wrapper](/feel-engine-wrapper) is a small, native-compiled Quarkus server wrapping the [connector-sdk/feel-wrapper](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/tree/main/connector-sdk/feel-wrapper), which itself wraps the feel engine for use in connectors.


For convenience, both apps can be packaged into a single Docker image using the top-level Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml.

Alternatively, the Python connector runtime can be started directly (see below) and the feel-engine-wrapper has multiple Dockerfiles (native or JVM) in [src/main/docker](feel-engine-wrapper/src/main/docker).

### Build

#### Connectors 
```bash
cd bpm-ai-connectors-c8
```
Python 3.11+ and Poetry 1.6.1 is required.

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
poetry install
```
Run the connectors:
```bash
python -m bpm_ai_connectors_c8.main
```

#### Feel Engine Wrapper
```bash
cd feel-engine-wrapper
```
Build native executable:
```bash
./mvnw package -Dnative
```
Run it:
```bash
./target/feel-engine-wrapper-runner
```

### Tests

Run integration test:

```bash
export ZEEBE_TEST_IMAGE_TAG=8.4.0 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<put your key here> 
poetry run pytest
```

The tests will:
* spin up a Zeebe test engine using [pytest-zeebe](https://github.com/holunda-io/pytest-zeebe)
* start a mocked feel engine wrapper server
* deploy and run a small test process for each connector, using the actual OpenAI API

The CI/CD pipeline additionally runs these tests against the actual built Docker image before pushing the `latest` tag to Docker Hub.
